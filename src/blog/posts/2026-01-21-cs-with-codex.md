title: Building a fast personal site
summary: Why I kept this site static, tiny, and incredibly quick.

I wanted this site to feel instant, so I made it static and kept the surface area small. No heavy frameworks, no extra scripts, and just enough CSS to keep the layout clean.

A few principles I’m following:
- Ship HTML first, then sprinkle enhancements.
- Keep CSS lean and predictable.
- Optimize media before it ever touches the site.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies.

The goal is the same every week: publish on schedule without slowing the site down.
